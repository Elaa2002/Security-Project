# Security-Project
This project focuses on developing a secure web scraping tool to collect customer reviews from Decathlon website. The data is extracted, cleaned, and analyzed to assess customer satisfaction. BI tools are then used to visualize sentiment trends and key satisfaction indicators.

# Web Scraping for Assessing Customer Satisfaction

##  Project Overview

This project aims to automate the collection of customer reviews from an e-commerce website and analyze the data to assess customer satisfaction levels.  
It was developed as part of the **IT-360 Information Assurance and Security** course under the supervision of **Pr. Manel Abdelkader**.

The project includes:
- Secure and ethical web scraping.
- Data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Visualization of customer satisfaction insights using BI tools.

##  Technologies Used

- **Python** (BeautifulSoup, Requests, Pandas)
- **Power BI** (for data visualization)
- **VS Code** (for data processing)
- **GitHub** (for version control)

##  Ethical Considerations

- Respect the site's `robots.txt` policies.
- No personal data scraping.
- Data is used strictly for educational purposes.

##  Deliverables

- Scraping Script (.py/.ipynb)
- Cleaned Dataset (.csv)
- Dashboard (Power BI .pbix file)
- Project Report (PDF)
